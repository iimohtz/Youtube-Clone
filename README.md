# YouTube Clone - CSS Layout Masterclass

A high-fidelity YouTube homepage clone built to demonstrate mastery of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Responsive Design. This project focuses on complex UI orchestration, specifically independent scroll containers and a fluid video discovery grid.
## 🚀 Key Features

    Hybrid Layout Engine: Uses CSS Grid for the primary application skeleton (Header/Sidebar/Main) and Flexbox for internal component alignment.

    Independent Scroll Zones: The Header remains fixed, the Sidebar can be scrolled for subscriptions, and the Main content area scrolls through videos independently.

    Responsive Video Grid: Utilizes the repeat(auto-fill, minmax()) algorithm to automatically adjust the number of columns based on screen width without media queries.

    Modern UI/UX: Includes hover-scale effects, custom scrollbar styling, and a "Line-Clamp" feature to handle multi-line video titles gracefully.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

    HTML5: Semantic markup for accessibility.

    CSS3: Featuring Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties (Variables).

    SVG Icons: High-resolution icons for a crisp look at any zoom level.
